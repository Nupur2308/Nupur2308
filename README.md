## Hello! :wave: I'm Nupur

### I'm a data analyst from India. Here's my journey for the past 10 years! 

Schooling in Bangalore :palm_tree: <br />
Went to Bombay for my undergrad in Media Studies :ocean: <br />
Spent 2 snowy winters in Syracuse getting my MBA :snowflake: <br /> 
Landed a job with Publicis in NYC! :cityscape: <br /> 
Spent 5 years in Creative and Media agencies strengthening my analytics skills :muscle: <br /> 
And now, I'm about to move to Toronto! :canada: <br /> 

### I'm currently learning ... 

<p class="f5">Machine Learning!</p>

It's my latest obsession. The resources I've been using are... 

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Andrew Ng's Stanford course</a>
<a href="https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/ML-Bootcamp-July/">An ML Bootcamp with Code for Cause</a>

This github repo is to record all my learnings as I traverse the analytics professional world. <br />
You can reach me on Twitter: @MessyN23 and LinkedIn: @nupurgokhale 

Pronouns: She/her
Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of cycling, and while in NY, I biked the perimeter of Manhattan just to see how long it would take me. (I took me 3 hrs because I got lost in Harlem!)
